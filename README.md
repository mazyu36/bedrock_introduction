# Amazon BedrockのAPI実装
[Amazon Bedrock超入門](https://www.shuwasystem.co.jp/book/9784798071923.html) を参考にBedrockを使用した様々なAPIを実装したもの。

AWS CDKで構築している。また API は Lambda Function URLs を活用して実装している。

    "titan": " Nobunaga was a Japanese daimyo (feudal lord) who unified Japan in the late 16th century. He is known for his military tactics, including the use of castles and ambushes, and for his political skills, which helped him to consolidate power and establish a stable government. Nobunaga was born in 1534 in the province of Aichi in Japan. He was the son of a minor provincial lord, but he quickly rose through the ranks of the military due to his skill and ambition. In 1560, Nobunaga attacked the castle of Imagawa Ujinao, which marked the beginning of his rise to power. He quickly defeated other rival clans and unified Japan under his rule. Nobunaga was known for his innovative military tactics, which included the use of castles and ambushes. He also developed a network of spies and informants, which allowed him to gather information about his enemies and plan his attacks accordingly. Nobunaga was also a skilled politician, and he was able to establish a stable government that was able to maintain order and stability in Japan. He was able to negotiate with other feudal lords and establish alliances, which helped him to expand his power and secure his position as the dominant force in Japan. However, Nobunaga's rise to power was not without its challenges. He was eventually betrayed by one of his closest allies, and he was defeated in the Battle of Nagashino in 1575. Despite his defeat, Nobunaga's legacy as a great Japanese ruler continues to be celebrated today. He is known for his contributions to Japanese culture, including the development of the tea ceremony and the promotion of literature and art. He is also remembered for his military tactics and his political skills, which helped to unify Japan and establish a stable government. In conclusion, Nobunaga was a great Japanese daimyo who unified Japan in the late 16th century. He was known for his innovative military tactics, political skills, and contributions to Japanese culture. His legacy continues to be celebrated today, and he is considered one of the most important figures in Japanese history.",
    "jurassic": "\nNobunaga Oda (1534-1582) was a powerful daimyo (feudal lord) and warlord who lived during the Sengoku period (period of warring states) in Japan. He is widely considered one of the greatest generals in Japanese history and is known for his military genius and ruthless tactics.\n\nNobunaga was born and raised as a member of the Oda clan, a powerful samurai family based in Owari province. He began his career by assisting his father, Oda Nobuhide, in expanding the clan's territory and power. Nobunaga eventually succeeded his father as head of the clan in 1551.\n\nOver the next two decades, Nobunaga embarked on a campaign to unify Japan under his control. He employed innovative military strategies and tactics, such as the use of firearms and advanced siege warfare, to gain control over large parts of the country. He also formed alliances with other powerful daimyo and utilized their forces to further his own ambitions.\n\nNobunaga's most notable achievement was the overthrow of the Ashikaga shogunate, the nominal ruler of Japan at the time. He captured Kyoto, the capital, in 1568 and effectively ended the shogunate's power. This made him the most powerful warlord in the country.\n\nDespite his success, Nobunaga's reign was not without its challenges. He was known for his ruthlessness, and he ordered the burning of Kyoto in 1576 to punish his enemies. He also faced resistance from other powerful daimyo, such as Takeda Shingen and Tokugawa Ieyasu, who sought to stop him in his quest for unification.\n\nNobunaga's reign came to an end in 1582 when he was betrayed and killed by one of his retainers, Akechi Mitsuhide. However, his legacy lived on, and after his death, other warlords continued his efforts to unify Japan. Eventually, Tokugawa Ieyasu emerged as the ruler of Japan and established the Tokugawa shogunate, which ruled the country for over 250 years.",
    "claude": " Nobunaga Oda (1534-1582) was a powerful daimyo (feudal lord) in Japan during the Sengoku period. Some key things to know about him:\n\n- He was the first of the three great unifiers of Japan along with his successors Hideyoshi Toyotomi and Ieyasu Tokugawa. He unified central Japan and built the foundations for the eventual unification of the country.\n\n- He was known as a ruthless but very innovative and strategic leader. He effectively utilized guns and adopted new military tactics that helped him defeat rival daimyo. This enabled him to gain control over much of central Japan.\n\n- He built a formidable castle known as Azuchi Castle, which represented his power and ambitions to rule over Japan. It had lavish decorations and artwork, demonstrating his immense wealth.\n\n- He was a patron of the arts and culture. He supported the emerging tea ceremony rituals and practices as well as Noh theater performances. This demonstrated his interest in cultural matters beyond just military conquests. \n\n- He died suddenly in 1582 when one of his generals betrayed him and staged a coup at Honn\u014d-ji temple in Kyoto. Though his rule was ended prematurely, Nobunaga laid the essential groundwork for those who unified Japan after him.\n\nIn summary, Nobunaga Oda was an immensely powerful warrior lord who used innovative military strategies to conquer much of medieval Japan, though his rule was cut short by betrayal just as he was nearing his goal of total national domination.",

He made great strides in uniting Japan under his control before his death.\n\n- He was known for his military brilliance and strategy. He pioneered the use of firearms and adopted new technologies into his armies, giving him a military advantage over rivals.\n\n- He built the foundation for the eventual unification of Japan under the Tokugawa shogunate. Though he did not completely unify Japan himself, he laid the groundwork that Hideyoshi and Ieyasu built upon. \n\n- He was known for his ruthlessness and ambition as he sought to increase his power. He eliminated rival daimyo through war, assassination and treachery among other means. \n\n- He had an interest in European trade and culture, welcoming Jesuit missionaries and traders to establish contacts overseas. This was an early catalyst for European cultural exchange with Japan.\n\n- His death was sudden - he was betrayed and forced to commit suicide after one of his generals turned against him in 1582. This prevented him from fully unifying Japan under his own rule and dynasty. His legacy lived on through Hideyoshi and Ieyasu after his demise."
