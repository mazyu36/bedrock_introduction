Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet foundation model is now generally available on Amazon Bedrock. The Claude 3 family of models (Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet, and Claude 3 Haiku) is the next generation of state-of-the-art models from Anthropic. For the vast majority of workloads, Sonnet is faster on inputs and outputs than Anthropic’s Claude 2 and 2.1 models, with higher levels of intelligence. Sonnet is also more steerable, delivering more predictable and higher quality outcomes. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models from leading AI companies, like Anthropic, along with a broad set of capabilities that provide you with the easiest way to build and scale generative AI applications with foundation models.

Claude's context window accepts up to 200,000 tokens (roughly 150,000 words, or over 500 pages of material). Claude 3 Sonnet is the clear choice for tasks that require complex reasoning and analysis with quick outputs. Data teams can use Sonnet for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), as well as search and retrieval across vast amounts of information while sales teams can leverage Sonnet for product recommendations, forecasting, and targeted marketing.
